* FrontendMentor

In this repository I have all the solutions for some FrontendMentor challenges
that I do, I will try to do as many challenges as possible as I am currently
learning web design, so I think it is really useful and I also hope this is
useful for you so we all learn together ðŸ¤—

** Licensing

All the code that I write (*.html*, *.css*) files are licenses under the
GPL-3.0-or-later license, I am not sure what's the license of the images and
resources provided by FrontendMentor, but every single line of code that's
written by me is under that license

** Things I want to do

I want to have a cute portfolio where I showcase some of my designs (including
these FrontendMentor challenges) so here are some things that I want to do
for that, mainly so I don't forget:

- [ ] A portfolio website
  - [ ] I want a hero with a cool pic of me?
  - [ ] A section where all my solutions are listed
    - [ ] Add a filter for the challenges based on difficulty

 When I think of anything else, I'll add it there
